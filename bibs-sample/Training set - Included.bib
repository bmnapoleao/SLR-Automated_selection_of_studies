The methodology is driven by practical problems, emphasis participatory research, and develops practically useful solutions in an iterative manner.Objective: Two objectives are to be achieved: (1) Understanding the state of the art with respect to action research usage in the software engineering literature, and (2) reflecting and providing recommendations of how to foster industry-academia collaboration through action research. Method: Based on our experience with two action research studies in close collaboration with Ericsson lessons learned and guidelines are presented.Results: In both cases presented action research led to multiple refinements in the interventions implemented. Furthermore, the close collaboration and co-production with the industry was essential to identify and describe the required refinements to provide an in-depth understanding. In comparison with previous studies, we required multiple iterations while previous software engineering studies reported mostly one iteration, or were not explicit regarding the number of iterations studied.Conclusion: We conclude that action research is a powerful tool for industry-academia collaboration. The success of the method highly depends on the researchers and practitioners working in a team. Future studies need to improve the reporting with respect to describing the type of action research used, the iterations, the model of collaboration, and the rationales for changes in each iteration.},

While researchers have spent years on post-university studies to learn the profession of data collection, data analysis, and data sensemaking, developers are trained to produce and deliver in time based on current best thinking. Taking different paths after the university studies soon ends up in different governing variables for developers and researchers of what brings value. This is a well-known phenomenon, and numerous articles and books are describing why this is the case (Barnes et al., Eur Manag J 20(3):272-285, 2002; Mathiassen, Inf Technol People 14(4):321-345, 2002; Mora-Valentin et al., Res Policy 33(1):17-40, 2004; Gorschek et al., IEEE Softw 23(6):88-95, 2006; Rombach and Achatz, Research collaboration between academia and industry.

In the Software Center we have found practical ways on how to make developers and researchers appreciate the same values and by that join forces to solve complex software engineering issues. A key instrument is to get close on all levels from steering groups to reference groups and research teams. In the following chapter, we describe how we in the Software Center work in practice to stimulate a close collaboration and what is required to make this work over time.}

We consider innovation as a process consisting of two phases, being technology creation and technology transfer. In this paper, we focus mainly on the transfer phase. Technology transfer is of mutual interest to both academia and industry. Transfer is important for academia, because it shows the industrial relevance of their research results to, for example, their sponsoring authorities. Showing the industrial applicability of research results is sometimes referred to as valorization of research. Nowadays, valorization is often required by research funding bodies. The transfer is important for industries, because innovating their development processes and their products is supportive in gaining a competitive edge or remaining competitive in their business. We describe the technology transfer phase by means of three activities: technology evaluation, technology engineering, and technology embedding. The technology evaluation activity is perceived as the main gate between the technology creation phase and the technology transfer phase. With two case studies, originating from the Dutch high-tech systems industry, we will illustrate the activities in the transfer phase. In addition to the process we will also define the main roles in a software engineering technology innovation, namely: the technology provider (academic research, industrial research and technology vendor) and the technology receiver (industrial development). With those roles we also address the issues concerning the ownership of technologies.}

Empirical studies in general and empirical studies in industrial settings in particular have played an important role in successful transition of many Software Engineering technologies to industry, for example, defect detection techniques and automated test cases. However, conducting empirical research in industrial settings remains a challenging undertaking for a variety of reasons. There is no substantial literature reporting on the challenges and complexities involved in conducting empirical studies in an industry in general and in settings whose business models are built around global sourcing. This paper reports some of our experiences and lessons learned from conducting empirical research in industry. Some of the observed challenges include short time horizon for research, high expectations, limited research skills, and the ‘acceptable’ research rigor. The paper discusses some of these issues with relevant examples and provides some strategies for overcoming these issues. We also stress that researchers and practitioners should share their experiences of conducting empirical research in order to help build a body of knowledge to guide the future efforts.},

The taxonomy architecture provides a basis for classifying research from a problem perspective which in turn supports the breaking down of complex practical challenges to researchable units. Thus such taxonomy may support the mapping of challenges in industry to research solutions in the software engineering context.Method: In this paper we present SERP and exemplifies its usage based on two literature studies in the field of software engineering. Further, we discuss how a taxonomy based on this architecture could have helped us in two past research projects that were conducted in close collaboration with industry. Finally we validate SERP by applying it to the area of software testing, developing SERP-test, and interviewing two industry practitioners and two researchers.Results: The taxonomy architecture has been applied to two problems in software testing, and has been assessed through interviews with practitioners and researchers. The interviews provided suggestions of how to improve the taxonomy architecture, which have been incorporated. With two examples, we demonstrated how the taxonomy architecture could be used to find solutions for industrial problems, and to find the problems addressed by a particular solution.Conclusion: SERP may be useful in multiple ways: (1) Given that SERP taxonomies are populated with industrial problems and scientific solutions, we could rapidly identify candidate research solutions for industrial practice. (2) Researchers could benefit from the taxonomy in the reporting of their research to ease the mapping to industrial challenges.},

If not adressed upfront, they may hinder collaboration in such projects. We analyze our experiences from a 10 year industry--academia collaboration program, the EASE Industrial Excellence Center in Sweden, and identify issues and feasible practices to overcome the hurdles of different time horizons. Specifically, we identify issues related to contracts, goals, results, organization (in)stability, and work practices. We identify several areas where the time horizon is different, and conclude that mutual awareness of these differences and management commitment to the collaboration are the key means to overcome the differences. The launch of a mediating institute may also be part of the solution.},

	abstract     = {The Fraunhofer Gesellschaft e.V. in Germany is Europe's largest and most successful organization for applied research and technology transfer. Its 48 institutes cover all areas of technology and engineering, ranging from materials and production technology to information and communication technology and solar energy. The Fraunhofer Institute for Experimental Software Engineering (IESE) in Kaiserslautern, Germany, focuses on software engineering methods, software product and process management, and learning organization concepts for software. It applies an experiment- or feedback-based transfer model, which has led to many successful and sustained improvements in the industrial practice of software development. In this paper, the underlying transfer model, key business areas and core competencies of Fraunhofer IESE, as well as examples of industrial transfer projects are illustrated. The presentation concludes with arguments as to why this transfer approach is well-suited for software development and why it is a prerequisite for the professionalization of software development.},

The purpose of this paper is to share the authors' experience and lessons learnt in conducting empirical case studies within software process improvement in cooperation with industry. In particular, we focus on the potential conflicts between the organizational goals and the research goals. Our experiences are summarized in terms of guidelines that we believe are useful for researchers in this area.},

Based on notes, minutes of meetings, and progress reports, the project history is outlined. The project is analyzed, using collaboration models as a frame of reference. We conclude that there must be a balance between company 'pull' and academia 'push' in the collaboration Management support is inevitably a key factor to success, while other factors like cross-cultural skills and interfaces towards key resources also contribute.},

An example is the industry-academia collaboration described in this paper among everis, an IT consulting firm, and the GESSI research group at UPC. The goal of this paper is twofold: to evaluate the success of the collaboration, and to report the experience with conducting empirical studies in the industry and lessons learnt. We evaluated our collaboration with an existing model for technology transfer, and performed a focus group discussion to identify challenges we have faced. After initialization and alignment of the collaboration, a high maturity level has been achieved: we have obtained the first results in form of proposed solutions, scientific publications, and pilots run in real projects. In spite of this positive progress, further initiatives need to be undertaken in the last phases of the collaboration to achieve high degrees of maturity in deployment impact, industry benefit and innovativeness. Evaluating the collaboration has been positive, since we identified the next steps to be taken to achieve a high degree of technology transfer and innovation dissemination. We think it is a needed step in industry-academia collaborations in order to improve their success.},

In addition, major incentives for using RE methods are discussed, along with ideas for improving current RE practice.
